## Resubmission

I’m sorry for the frequent updates to the **sdsfun** package. This happened because **sdsfun** serves as a core dependency for other packages I’m developing, like **gdverse**, **spEDM**, and **itmsa**. 
As new functions were needed for these packages, they were added to **sdsfun**, which led to more frequent updates than I intended. This submission fixes a bug in **spEDM** caused by a function in 
**sdsfun** that resulted in empty computation results. I’ll be more mindful about managing update frequency in the future and avoid unnecessary submissions.
